# Link Storage

## Motivation

My dad had trouble keeping track of all electronic forms his employers were sending out so I made a web application where he could search and keep track of them all.

## Results

The web application is now in use by most of the employees in his branch.

## Technical Details

The frontend was built using ReactJS, MaterialUI components, and written in TypeScript. The backend is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS also written in TypeScript with a PostgreSQL database.
